# Cybersecurity Projects – README

## Overview

This repository contains five of my cybersecurity projects, each demonstrating practical skills in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, risk analysis, and incident response. These projects are based on real-world scenarios, applying industry frameworks and security best practices to assess, mitigate, and respond to threats.

source : https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-2523

**Objective:**
Conducted a penetration test on a Metasploitable 2 environment to identify and exploit vulnerabilities using Kali Linux.

**What I Did:**

* Discovered an open FTP port running **Vsftpd v2.3.4**, known for a backdoor vulnerability.
* Simulated an attack to demonstrate remote shell access and potential impact.
* Documented the risks, including data theft, server hijacking, and malware persistence.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Vulnerability research and exploitation.
* Using penetration testing tools in Kali Linux.
* Risk documentation and remediation planning.

**Key Takeaway:**
Highlighted the importance of proactive vulnerability scanning and firewall/antivirus deployment to prevent backdoor exploitation.

**Objective:**
Performed a risk assessment for a social media organization after a major data breach.

**What I Did:**

* Identified four critical weaknesses: password sharing, default admin credentials, no firewall traffic filtering, and no MFA.
* Recommended a hardening plan involving **MFA**, revised baseline configurations, and **port filtering**.
* Used NIST framework to help with making recommendations during security hardening. 

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Security policy creation.
* Applying NIST-based risk management principles.
* Network security hardening.

**Key Takeaway:**
Strengthened network posture through policy, access control, and configuration improvements.

**Objective:**
Analyze and respond to a simulated DDoS incident caused by an ICMP flood.

**What I Did:**

* Identified the cause as an **unconfigured firewall**.
* Designed a layered defense strategy using firewall rules, network segmentation, IDS/IPS, and traffic monitoring.
* Outlined recovery steps for restoring services.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Incident handling using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**.
* Network traffic analysis.
* DDoS mitigation techniques.

**Key Takeaway:**
Prepared an incident response playbook to contain and recover from high-volume network attacks.

## **4. Security News Research & Mitigation Strategies**

**Objective:**
Research and analyze recent security incidents to propose prevention strategies.

**What I Did:**

* Investigated three high-profile security issues:

  1. **Phishing Trends (2025)** – AI-driven phishing, QR phishing, deepfake scams.
  2. **Life Insurance Data Breach** – Weak access controls exposing sensitive records.
  3. **Grubhub Vendor Breach** – Compromised third-party account.
* Proposed AI-driven filtering, Zero Trust adoption, SOAR/SIEM/XDR integration, and vendor risk management.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Threat intelligence research.
* Security awareness program design.
* Policy recommendations for access control and third-party risk.

**Key Takeaway:**
Showcased ability to translate threat research into actionable business security strategies.

## **5. Vulnerability Assessment – MySQL Database Server**

**Objective:**
Assess the security posture of a Linux-based MySQL database server.

**What I Did:**

* Evaluated access controls, network exposure, and dependency risks.
* Scored risks based on **likelihood** and **impact** using **NIST SP 800-30** methodology.
* Recommended multi-factor authentication, IP allow-listing, and TLS encryption.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* Vulnerability assessment methodology.
* Secure configuration of database environments.
* Risk prioritization and remediation planning.

**Key Takeaway:**
Reinforced the critical role of access control and encryption in protecting high-value business assets.
